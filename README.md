# CRISIS TOOLS

## A Bash script to install all the tools recommended by Brendan Gregg in his book _"Systems Performance. Enterprise and the Cloud. 2nd. Edition"_

This is just a simple bash script to install all the tools that Gregg explain in his 4th Chapter.

A generic installer for RedHat and Debian Systems. Has been tested in (some bare metal and some VM):

-Redhat: RHEL, Fedora, CentOS.


-Debian: Ubuntu Server, Debian Testing.

> "When you have a production performance crisis that requires various perfomance tools to debug it, you might find that none of them are installed. Worse, since the server is suffering a perfomance issue, installing the tools may take much long than usual, prologing the crisis." - Brendan Gregg

Feel free to use/adapt this code to your needs. Not only for a crisis :).


Brendan Gregg Github tools are not included in this script.

Thanks Brendan for your amazing book.
